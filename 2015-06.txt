    - measuring shape of the fastOR signal:


    - no dependency for single plane or in telescope

    - the signal of two activated pixels in one column or one double column is identical
    to one pix activated

    - also a whole activated double column looks identical

    - if whole single row is active fastOR still identical

    and so on)

    considerably
