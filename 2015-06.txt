    - measuring shape of the fastOR signal:


    - no dependency for single plane or in telescope

    - all single pixel fastORs look exactly identical independent of the position
    of the pixel on the ROC

    - the signal of two activated pixels in one column or one double column is identical
    to one pix activated

    - also a whole activated double column looks identical

    - if whole single row is active fastOR still identical

    - shape depends if consecutive double cols are hit (one is hit and the next isnt
    and so on)

    - used mask where only every second double col is activated --> changes shape
    considerably

    - adding the second pixel in the DC doesn''t change shape

    - enabling all rows doesn''t chang it either

    - neither putting in spaces in rows

    - double puls starts showing for more than 65 activated rows

    - saving pics for every second DC
